#Spark Demos 

##TLDR;
Spark is a distributed computing platform that has a python API.  For people accustomed to python programing, there are analogous functions such as map, filter, and sort.  The quickest way to get started is to grab a Spark 2.0 docker image attached to a Jupyter notebook, which you can find here: https://hub.docker.com/r/ezamir/jupyter-spark-2.0/

##Background
Spark is an open sourced platform for distributed computation.  Originally written in scala, it has API's for scala, java, R, and of course, python.  You can read more on the Spark website http://spark.apache.org/
